Project Overview
The "Domain Analyzer" is a sophisticated web application designed to perform comprehensive network analysis for a given domain. Built with a modern JavaScript stack, it leverages React for the frontend, TypeScript for type safety, Vite for bundling, and Express for the backend API. The application provides detailed insights into DNS records, connectivity metrics, routing paths, and network configuration, enhanced by reusable components for data visualization and user interaction. The project structure is modular and well-organized, supporting scalability and maintainability.

Detailed Functionality and Features
Backend (server.js)
The Express server, running on port 3001, provides RESTful endpoints with robust security and performance optimizations:

DNS Analysis (/api/dns/:domain):
Executes nslookup, dig, and host to retrieve DNS records.
Includes mock whois data due to potential WebContainer constraints.
Parses A records for visualization.
Caches results for 5 minutes to reduce redundant queries.

Connectivity Analysis (/api/connectivity/:domain):
Runs ping -c 4 to measure response times (avg, min, max).
Uses curl to check HTTP status.
Includes mock telnet data.
Parses ping output for charting.

Routing Analysis (/api/routing/:domain):
Executes traceroute (with mock data if unavailable) to map hops.
Parses hop data (hop number, hostname, IP, time) for graph visualization.

Network Configuration (/api/network):
Retrieves hostname and mock ifconfig/netstat data.
Provides network interface details (e.g., IP, netmask, status).

Health Check (/api/health):
Returns server status for monitoring.

Security and Performance:
Input validation with regex and sanitize-html.
Rate limiting (100 requests per 15 minutes per IP).
Command execution with 30-second timeout and 1MB buffer.
In-memory caching to optimize API calls.

Frontend (App.tsx and Components)
The frontend is a single-page application with a responsive, Tailwind-styled interface:

App.tsx:
Manages state (domain, results, loading, error, analysisComplete) with useState.
Performs parallel API calls using Promise.allSettled for efficiency.
Displays DomainInput, LoadingSpinner, ErrorMessage, and ResultsDisplay conditionally.


Component Details:

ChartComponent.tsx:
Renders bar or line charts with recharts.
Supports customizable data, type, title, xKey, yKey, and color.
Includes CartesianGrid, Tooltip, and a no-data fallback.

DataTable.tsx:
Displays tabular data with dynamic columns (key, label, optional render).
Features responsive scrolling, custom cell rendering, and a no-data message.

ErrorMessage.tsx:
Shows errors with an AlertTriangle icon and optional Retry button (RefreshCw).
Styled with a red theme.

DomainInput.tsx:
Validates domain input with regex, handles Enter key, and shows inline errors.
Includes a loading state and example domains.

LoadingSpinner.tsx:
Offers configurable size (sm, md, lg) and text.
Uses a spinning border animation.

NetworkGraph.tsx:
Visualizes hops with hop numbers, hostnames, IPs, and times.
Displays summary stats (total hops, min/max times) in a grid.


ResultsDisplay.tsx:

Provides tabbed navigation (dns, connectivity, routing, network) with icons.
Exports results as a JSON file.
Renders charts, tables, and raw outputs:

DNS: Bar chart for response times, table for records.
Connectivity: Line chart for ping times, summary stats.
Routing: Network graph, hop table.
Network: Interface table, system info.


Capabilities

Comprehensive Analysis: Covers DNS, connectivity, routing, and network configuration.
Data Visualization: Supports charts, tables, and graphs for intuitive data interpretation.
Interactivity: Offers tab navigation, data export, and retry options.
Error Handling: Gracefully manages missing data and API failures.
Performance: Leverages caching and parallel requests.

Proposed Enhancements
To elevate the application, the following additions are recommended:

Nmap Capabilities:
Integrate Nmap to scan the domain for open ports, services, and vulnerabilities.
Add a /api/nmap/:domain endpoint to the backend, executing commands like nmap -sS -O <domain> with sanitized input.
Parse results to display port status, service versions, and OS detection in a new NmapTab in ResultsDisplay.

Enhanced Dig Command:
Extend the DNS endpoint to use dig +trace for authoritative server tracing and dig +all for all record types (e.g., MX, NS, TXT).
Parse additional records and include them in the DNS table and chart.

DNS Checker:
Integrate a DNS checker (e.g., via dig against multiple resolvers or a third-party API like Google Public DNS) to validate records across providers.
Display consistency checks and resolver-specific data in the DNS tab.

Design Update:
Adopt modern fonts (e.g., Inter or Roboto) for a contemporary look.
Implement glassy buttons and UI elements using Tailwind classes like bg-white bg-opacity-70 backdrop-blur-sm, with subtle hover effects (hover:bg-opacity-80).
Maintain a stable, elegant, and uncluttered design, avoiding excessive complexity.

This re-described "Domain Analyzer" offers a robust, modern, and extensible tool for network analysis as of 04:05 AM EEST on Monday, August 04, 2025, with enhanced security and visualization capabilities while preserving a user-friendly interface.
